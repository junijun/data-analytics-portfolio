# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of data analytics projects developed using **Python, SQL, and data visualization tools**.  
The portfolio demonstrates practical skills in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), KPI calculation, and business-oriented insights**, aligned with entry-level Data Analytics and Analytics Engineering roles.

## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in **Technical Systems Operation** with an academic background in **Transportation Systems** and a strong interest in **data analytics**.  
I am passionate about using data to analyze system performance, identify patterns, and support decision-making.

I have hands-on experience with **Python and SQL** through self-driven learning and practical projects. I have completed multiple **Udemy courses focused on Python for Data Analysis** and recently finished the **IBM Data Fundamentals program with a capstone project**, strengthening my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data-driven problem solving.

I am currently building my professional portfolio to transition into a **Data Analytics** role.
