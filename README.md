# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of **data analytics projects** focused on
inventory management, demand analysis, and decision support in supply chain and
warehouse operations.

The portfolio demonstrates how **Python and SQL** can be used to transform
operational data into **actionable business insights**, with an emphasis on
clear analysis, realistic scenarios, and decision-oriented outcomes.

## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in **Technical Systems Operation** with an academic background
in **Transportation Systems** and a strong interest in **data analytics**.

I have hands-on experience with **Python and SQL**, supported by self-driven learning,
Udemy courses in Python for Data Analysis, and the **IBM Data Fundamentals program
with a capstone project**.

This portfolio was developed to support my transition into a
**Data Analytics Engineering / Data Analyst Trainee** role.
