# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of data analytics projects focused on inventory management, demand analysis, and decision support in supply chain and warehouse operations.

The portfolio demonstrates how Python and SQL can be used to transform operational data into actionable business insights, with an emphasis on structured analysis, realistic warehouse scenarios, and decision-oriented outcomes.

## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in Technical Systems Operation with an academic background in Transportation Systems and a strong interest in data analytics applied to logistics and warehouse operations.

I have hands-on experience with Python and SQL, supported by continuous self-learning, Udemy courses in Python for Data Analysis, and the IBM Data Fundamentals program (including a capstone project).

This portfolio has been developed to support my transition into a Data Analytics Engineering / Data Analyst Trainee role.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Inventory & Demand Analysis (Python)
**Folder:** `InventoryAnalysis/`

**Purpose:**  
Analyze warehouse inventory and demand patterns to identify stockout risks, demand variability, and opportunities to improve replenishment decisions.

**Key focus:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Warehouse KPIs (fill rate, stockout days/rate, inventory trends)
- Time-series inventory behavior per SKU
- Insights and recommendations for inventory planning

**Tools:** Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

### 2. SQL Analytics – Inventory & Demand KPIs
**Folder:** `SQLAnalytics/`

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrate the use of SQL for analytical querying and KPI calculation using warehouse operational data stored in a SQLite database.

**Key focus:**
- Inventory and demand KPIs using SQL
- SKU-level analysis
- Stockout risk and inventory health indicators
- Business-oriented SQL analysis for decision support

**Tools:** SQL (SQLite), Python, Jupyter Notebook

### 3. Inventory Optimization – Scenario Analysis
**Folder:** `InventoryOptimization/`

**Purpose:**  
Evaluate inventory policy scenarios and quantify trade-offs between service level and inventory holding cost.

**Key focus:**
- What-if scenario analysis
- Safety stock and service-level trade-offs
- SKU-specific inventory strategies
- Decision support for inventory policy design

**Tools:** Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
