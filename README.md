# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of data analytics projects focused on inventory management, demand analysis, and decision support in supply chain and warehouse operations.

The portfolio demonstrates how Python and SQL can be used to transform operational data into actionable business insights, with an emphasis on structured analysis, realistic warehouse scenarios, and decision-oriented outcomes.

## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in Technical Systems Operation with an academic background in Transportation Systems and a strong interest in data analytics applied to logistics and warehouse operations.

I have hands-on experience with Python and SQL, supported by continuous self-learning, Udemy courses in Python for Data Analysis, and the IBM Data Fundamentals program (including a capstone project).

This portfolio has been developed to support my transition into a Data Analytics Engineering / Data Analyst Trainee role.

## Projects Overview

This portfolio is structured as an **Inventory Analytics Pipeline**, where each module builds on the previous one.

### 1. Inventory & Demand Analysis (Python) — Part 1: Diagnostics
**Folder:** `InventoryAnalysis/`

**Purpose:**  
Analyze daily warehouse demand and inventory behavior to identify stockout risks, demand variability, and replenishment performance.

**Key focus:**
- Data validation and preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Warehouse KPIs (fill rate, stockout days/rate, average inventory, lost sales)
- SKU-level insights and operational findings

**Tools:** Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

---

### 2. Inventory Optimization — Part 2: Policy Evaluation and Improvement
**Folder:** `InventoryOptimization/`

**Purpose:**  
Build on the KPI baseline from Part 1 and evaluate inventory policy scenarios to improve the trade-off between service level and inventory cost.

**Key focus:**
- Scenario analysis and policy comparison
- Service level improvement strategies
- Cost-based inventory evaluation (holding vs stockout impact)
- SKU-specific inventory recommendations

**Tools:** Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

---

### 3. SQL Analytics – Inventory & Demand KPIs (Supporting Module)
**Folder:** `SQLAnalytics/`

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrate the use of SQL for analytical querying and KPI reporting using warehouse-style operational data stored in a SQLite database.

**Key focus:**
- Inventory and demand KPI calculations in SQL
- SKU-level diagnostics and reporting
- Business-oriented analysis and decision support queries

**Tools:** SQL (SQLite), Python, Jupyter Notebook

## Portfolio Focus

This portfolio emphasizes:
- Business-relevant analytics problems in warehouse and supply chain operations
- Clear, structured analytical workflows (diagnostics → KPIs → optimization)
- Translating data into decision-ready insights and recommendations
- Practical inventory planning use cases (demand variability, stockouts, lead time, replenishment policy)
- Reproducible analysis with Python, SQL, and version control via Git/GitHub

---

## Notes
- All projects are self-contained and reproducible.
- HTML reports may be included for review without running code (where available).
- The portfolio is continuously refined as part of my professional development.

Thank you for reviewing my portfolio.
