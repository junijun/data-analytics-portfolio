## 👤 About Me
I am a PhD candidate in **Technical Systems Operation** with an academic background in **Transportation Systems** and a strong interest in **data analytics**.  
I am passionate about using data to analyze system performance, identify patterns, and support decision-making.

I have hands-on experience with **Python and SQL** through self-driven learning and practical projects. I have completed multiple **Udemy courses focused on Python for Data Analysis** and recently finished the **IBM Data Fundamentals program with a capstone project**, strengthening my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data-driven problem solving.

I am currently building my professional portfolio to transition into a **Data Analytics** role.
