# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of data analytics projects focused on inventory management, demand analysis, and decision support in supply chain and warehouse operations.

The portfolio demonstrates how Python and SQL can be used to transform operational data into actionable business insights, with an emphasis on structured analysis, realistic warehouse scenarios, and decision-oriented outcomes.

## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in Technical Systems Operation with an academic background in Transportation Systems and a strong interest in data analytics applied to logistics and warehouse operations.

I have hands-on experience with Python and SQL, supported by continuous self-learning, Udemy courses in Python for Data Analysis, and the IBM Data Fundamentals program (including a capstone project).

This portfolio has been developed to support my transition into a Data Analytics Engineering / Data Analyst Trainee role.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Inventory & Demand Analysis (Python)
**Folder:** `InventoryAnalysis/`

**Purpose:**  
Analyze warehouse inventory and demand patterns to identify stockout risks, demand variability, and opportunities to improve replenishment decisions.

**Key focus:**
- Data validation and cleaning for time-series warehouse data
- Exploratory analysis of demand and inventory trends per SKU
- Operational KPIs (fill rate, stockout days/rate, inventory behavior)
- Value-based metrics (lost sales value and inventory value)
- Business insights and recommendations

**Tools:** Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

### 2. Inventory Optimization (Scenario-Based Policy Evaluation)
**Folder:** `InventoryOptimization/`

**Purpose:**  
Evaluate alternative replenishment policy scenarios to quantify the trade-off between service level and inventory investment.

**Key focus:**
- Baseline performance benchmark (from Project 1)
- Scenario design using buffer coverage (`cover_days`)
- KPI comparison across scenarios (fill rate, stockout rate, lost sales value)
- Delta vs baseline evaluation to quantify improvements
- Policy recommendations per SKU

**Tools:** Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

### 3. SQL Analytics – Inventory & Demand KPIs
**Folder:** `SQLAnalytics/`

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrate the use of SQL for analytical querying and KPI calculation using warehouse operational data stored in a SQLite database.

**Key focus:**
- Inventory and demand KPIs using SQL queries
- SKU-level analysis and stockout indicators
- Business-oriented reporting and decision support querying

**Tools:** SQL (SQLite), Python, Jupyter Notebook
